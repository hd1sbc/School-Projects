The following are the instructions and my answers to the project. The contents of the files in this folder have been edited for security reasons, to prevent cheating/copying, and to clarify various aspects of the directory. 

### 1. Identify a predictive research question
*Does the number of high-value/recognizable players (determined as players paid within the top 5% of salaries) generate more revenue for teams in the NBA?*

`More info on the thought process behind the question can be found in the word document included in the submitted folder`

### 2. Select an existing dataset (you should not run an experiment or generate new data).
`I used two sources to provide the data. The links to and details about how I collected and organized the data can be found in the word document included in the submitted folder`

### 3. Found in this directory: the five general steps of data analytics using Python:
- Import
- Explore (i.e.,Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Manipulate (i.e., pre-processing)
- Analyze
    - Select and run three (3) to five (5) unique, appropriate algorithms from Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning (ML) that we have learned in the course. This should include an evaluation of the models and error metrics.
- Visualize (though you may need to iterate at each step and/or back-track to previous steps).

### 4. Communicate your insights (i.e., findings, conclusions)
`See Write-Up.md for details`
